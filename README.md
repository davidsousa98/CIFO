 The main objective of this project is to explore Optimization concepts through the implementation of several algorithms and genetic operators well known in the field of Genetic Algorithm. 

This project is composed of two common problems in this area, Travel Salesman Problem (TSP) and Portfolio Investment Problem (PIP). 

The first problem consists in tracing the shortest possible route between 90 cities, for which were given city coordinates and a square matrix indicating the distances between all pair combinations of cities. 
Additionally, the second problem resides in maximizing the portfolio expected return based on real data from stock options of all companies comprised of the S&P 500's index. 

For both cases, our main goal is to outperform the baseline version of the Genetic Algorithm initially provided.
